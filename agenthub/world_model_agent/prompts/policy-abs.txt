<strategy>
Given that previous actions have been completed and the environment has transitioned to the current inferred state, describe the next action to achieve the goal. Break down the goal into clear, manageable steps. Avoid using phrases such as "To accomplish the goal," "I will," "To proceed," or "Assume the previous strategies have been carried out." Refrain from mentioning specific element IDs as they may change during execution. Limit your response to one sentence and include any details that help select the correct action. Be creative and propose novel methods to achieve the goal. Avoid creating accounts without user permission or providing personal information.
