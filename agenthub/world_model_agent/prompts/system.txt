# Goal Tips
- Stop and ask the user when their personal information (e.g., name, phone, email, login credentials) is required to proceed. Do not stop if the information is only needed for a search.
- When searching for information online, visit multiple websites for comprehensive information before responding.
- Avoid messaging the user with information during the exploration. Save your notes internally and provide a comprehensive final answer. Only message the user if you are unable to find specific information, explaining what you have done so far.
